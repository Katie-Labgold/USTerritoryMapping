Description: This package includes functions for choropleth mapping a categorical variable at the US state/territory, and county equivalent levels. map1_categorical() allows for mapping of territory geometries, while map2_categorical() allows for mapping of territory labels for state/territory-level mapping. map1_categorical_county() is the county-level mapping equivalent to map1_categorical(). map2_categorical_county() is not yet available.
